git diff <branch> - shows difference between current branch and <branch>
git diff <commit-hash>

git log - shows commit logs, with hash values on each commit 
	HEAD -> is current location
	--all shows commits in all branches
git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate
	makes log look a little neater because it does not show account info, commit hash, etc.

git checkout <commit-hash> - pulls code from a specific commit
git checkout <branch> - creates a new branch if <branch> is not currently a branch, 
	otherwise switches to <branch>

git merge <branch> - merges <branch> into current branch

git reset --hard <commit-hash>
	--hard deletes all commits after the commit at <commit-hash> (inside the branch you are in. 
		Commits in other branches are safe)
		
git remote add origin
	remote is a repository "somewhere", it doesn't have to be on Github
	"origin" is the alias of the repo, but it doesn't have to be "origin"
	
git push -u origin master
	-u means remember this the next time I push, so next time I can just type $ git push
	
git fetch - tells you what changed but doesn't merge
