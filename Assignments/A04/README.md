This assignment calculates stats based on stats in the Midwestern State University phpMyAdmin server

## Notes on running the program
This is a mock repository. If completed, each file would query the server and calculate a different stat, printing out the top 5 results of each statistic.
Each file would be run independently of every other, and all would require config.php to authenticate the connection to the server.
